#summary Description of the TouScruino

= Introduction =

TouScruino is a contraction for Tou(ch panel) Scr(een) (Ard)uino.<br>
It is a versatile Arduino compatible board.<br>
It copies the connector positions of the Arduino Uno and offers almost the same functions at the same pin positions (PWM are remapped and I2C also).

= Features =

 * Can be used as a shield or as a standalone Arduino compatible board,  capable of plugging into shields.
 * TouScruino uses an Atmega1284, which has:
  * 12 more pins than the Atmega328. The TFT screen and the touch panels can be controlled by the processor without having to use the Arduino connector pins.
  * an additional serial port: Serial2. An XBee can be connected at the same time as an usb bridge.

By default, TouScruino contains a firmware which will draw the commands passed through the Serial2 pins (RX=D2 and TX=D3) on the screen, and returns upon request the position of the press on the touch panel.
