= How does it work ? =

===Overview===
http://ardurct.googlecode.com/svn/images/ArduRCT_detail1.png

The local and remote parts are based upon :
 * [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Hardware Arduino] compatible boards to allow for easy reprogramming for different type of RC vehicules.
 * [http://www.sparkfun.com/categories/111 XBee modems] to allow for the choice of transmitting power, and therefore of range.

The grey blocks form the minimum working system, the dashed ones are optional. <br>The red text describes which Arduino library is used to manage the block from the Arduino MCU.

The *local part* contains:
 * a [RCShield] which is an Arduino shield, containing:
  * various sensors to control the remote part
  * an XBee to send control commands and receive telemetry.
 * a [TouScruino] which is an Arduino compatible board. 
  * This main board can be replaced by any Arduino board conforming to the Arduino Uno footprint.

The *remote part* leverages a [Remotuino] to control servos and send back telemetry.

The two pink blocks go together: the GPS knows the position of the remote vehicule and the magnetometer can therefore give the position and the heading of the remote vehicule relative to the local station.<br>
This allows remote control without line of sight (fog, rain, darkness, long distance...).<br>
We assume that the local station is not moving too much, which is the case in most scenarios.
