#summary Details about the ArduRCT_Graphics library

= Arduino library for graphic screens =
==Content==
The library is designed to manage small screens such as TouScruino or the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/335">one from adafruit</a>.<br>
For the moment, it manages screens based on the S6D0H0, and the ST7735. It will soon manage ILI932x based screens.<br>
Porting the library for other screens or other MCUs is quite simple as the hardware has been completely abstracted: see [LibGraphicsCodeDetails code details]
==Functionalities ==
The screen can be rotated by 90 degree increments.
