==Joining==
When joined with TouScruino-avr, the complete assembly will have a double board thickness.
You should add a very thin layer of pastic (rows of transparent tape will do) on the back of the ui board to prevent electrical contacts.
Alternatively, you can have the UI completely separated from the avr/arm board and join them with wires.<br/>
When you receive the board, you will see 2 very long plates on both sides of the board. These should be cut before soldering the screen on the board. 
They can be glued on the avr or arm board to provide support for the screen (this is only required if you use the touch panel).
