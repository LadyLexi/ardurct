In the basic configuration, the local board has 3 channels (2 in a joystick, 1 in a potentiometer). <br>
This single board option is designed for use with cars (the potentiometer is the wheel, the joystick the speed) or boats. 
<br>
By using the buttons below the screen, a menu system can be displayed to enable a number of toggles (lights, sounds...).<br>
<br>
Features:
 * Arduino compatible
 * 2 slots to facilitate the attachment of a battery with a ziptie.
 * Battery connector and charger (up to 500mA)
 * I2C connector under the screen to attach a magnetometer
 * ULDO converter to be able to use the battery as much as possible without depleting it completely.
 * Oversized on-off button with handle big enough to go through a 3mm box.
 * Edge leds to display activity outside of the box
 * Edge connector to add a second screen and a second joystick
 * Can act as an Arduino programmer for any Arduino compatible board. This allows the Local board to upgrade the firmware of the Remote board.

As in most case PCBs are delivered in pairs by the fab houses, the board has been designed to be reversible. When you connect a second PCB at the right edge of the main board, you just have to populate the screen and the joystick and connect its left edge to the main board.<br>
This option gives you 5 direct channels plus any number of toggles.
It is designed for use with planes and quadcopters.
