#summary Details about the Touchscreen library

= Arduino library for touch screens =
==Content==
The library is designed to manage small touch screens such as TouScruino or the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/335">one from adafruit</a>.<br>
For the moment, it manages screens based on the SAMSUNG S6D06H chip on class. It will soon manage ILI932x based screens.<br>
Porting the library for other screens or other MCUs is quite simple as the hardware has been completely abstracted: see [LibTouchScreenCodeDetails code details]
==Functionalities ==
The library manages the screen and the touch panel, including its calibration.<br>
The screen can be rotated by 90 degree increments.
