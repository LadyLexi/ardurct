#summary Description of the TouScruino

== Introduction ==

TouScruino is a contraction for Tou(ch) Scr(een) (Ard)uino.<br>
It is a versatile Arduino compatible board: it copies the connector positions of the Arduino Uno (Rev. 3) and offers 
almost the same functions at the same pin positions (D3 is not a PWM anymore, it became TX1). 
See [PinMapping pins mapping] for details for TouScruino-avr.

== Features ==

 * Can be used as a standalone Arduino compatible board, capable of accepting shields (they are "under shields" though :)). 
 * Has a single cell LiPo charger and connector to allow battery operation, and a ULDO regulator to generate 3.3V from the LiPo battery. The charge is done through a micro USB connector.
 * Contains a screen and some input to interact with it: either a joystick, some buttons, or a touchpanel.

By default, TouScruino contains a firmware which will draw the commands passed through the Serial pins (RX=D0 and TX=D1) on the screen, 
and returns upon request the state of the inputs.

== Versions ==

To bring maximum flexibility and facilitate reusability, the user interface and main boards are kept separate. <br/> 
You only need one main board ans one user interface, but you can make your design evolve without loosing all previous investment.
===Main board===
At this stage only the avr version is fully functional. The arm version will come at a later date.<br>
<br>
<u>*avr*</u><br>
Content: ATMEGA1284 as MPU, AR1021 as touch controller.<br>
Status: work in progress.<br>
<br><br>
<u>*arm*</u><br>
Content: SAM3S100 as MPU, AR1021 as touch controller and EEPROM.<br>
Status: ideas stage.
<br><br>
===User Interface board===
A User Interface board should be connected on the TouScruino, using a 20 pins connector at the top of the board (the only one without edge connectors).<br>
At this stage three different ui boards have been designed. These can, of course, be re-used in any design.<br><br>
<u>*ui0*</u><br>
Content: PCD8544 as screen, 4 buttons for interaction.<br>
Status: finished<br>
Although usefull for simple interaction, the screen is too limited to be used for ArduRCT.

<u>*ui1*</u><br>
Content: JD-T1800 as screen, 4 buttons or a 5 ways switch for interaction.<br>
Status: work in progress.

<u>*ui2*</u><br>
Content: IL932X as touchscreen.<br>
Status: work in progress<br>
