#summary Description of the MP3 Player project

===Idea===
Combine the <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10628">MP3 Shield</a> from Sparkfun with TouScruino and a battery: we have a portable MP3 Player.

===Adaptations===
 * Since the shield only has, for whatever reason, the 5V wired as a power, we have to link the 3.3V pin with the output of the 3.3V regulator: quite easy to do.
 * We also have to remove the reset button since it is under the new IOREF pin...
