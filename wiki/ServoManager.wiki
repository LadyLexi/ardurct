===Content===
A library to manage [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9065 servo motors] connected to any pins of an Arduino compatible board .<br>
This library does not rely on a timer, it is therefore compatible with the [http://arduiniana.org/libraries/newsoftserial/ NewSoftSerial] library; but is not as precise as the standard Servo library.

===Example usage===
{{{
#include <ServoManager.h>

#define THROTTLE 0
#define THROTTLE_SERVO_PIN 2
#define THROTTLE_COMMAND A0

void setup() {
    // Attach the THROTTLE servo to THROTTLE_SERVO_PIN
    ServoManager.attach(THROTTLE, THROTTLE_SERVO_PIN);
    // set it to 2000 microseconds
    ServoManager.set(THROTTLE, 2000);
}

void loop() {
    // run the servo manager: needs to be called at least once per 20ms (50Hz)
    ServoManager.run();
	// wait between command reads
	delay(5);
	// adjust the servo position accordig to the command
	ServoManager.mapSet(THROTTLE, analogRead(THROTTLE_COMMAND), 0, 1023);
}
