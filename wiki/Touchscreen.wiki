 * Rectangles: filled or not, with variable thickness.
 * Circles: filled or not, with variable thickness.
 * Rounded rectangles: filled or not, with variable thickness.
 * Triangles: filled or not, with variable thickness.
 * Arcs: filled or not, with variable thickness.
 * Texts: 4 different size, bold and overlay
<br>
<u>*Macros functions:*</u><br>
Possibility to draw any of the above drawing through simple commands. See [MacroLanguage] for details.
<br><br>

The library is organized into layers.<br>
 * The Physical Layer manages the pins and buses.<br>
 * The Chip Management extends the Physical Layer. For the moment, it can manage:
  * S6D0H0
  * ILI932x
 * The Screen Hardware Abstraction Layer manages the low level drawing functions such as: circles, lines, patterns, fonts, bitmaps...
 * The Touchscreen layer manages the touch panel and the higher level functionalities, such as the user interface and the macros.
