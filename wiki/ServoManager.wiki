===Content===
A library to manage [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9065 servo motors] connected to any pins of an Arduino compatible board .<br>
This library relies on timer1, it is designed to be as compatible as possible with the [http://arduiniana.org/libraries/newsoftserial/ NewSoftSerial] library; Meaning that up to 19200 bauds, they will coexist happily. For higher speeds, the ServoManager library manages a RTS pin for receiving and an isPulsing() function to check before transmitting.

===Example usage===
{{{
#include <ServoManager.h>

#define THROTTLE 0
#define THROTTLE_SERVO_PIN 2
#define THROTTLE_COMMAND A0

void setup() {
    // Setup the ServoManager
    ServoManager.setup();
    // Attach the THROTTLE servo to THROTTLE_SERVO_PIN
    ServoManager.attach(THROTTLE, THROTTLE_SERVO_PIN);
    // set it to mid course
    ServoManager.set(THROTTLE, 90);
}

void loop() {
    // wait between command reads
    delay(5);
    // adjust the servo position according to the command
    ServoManager.mapSet(THROTTLE, analogRead(THROTTLE_COMMAND), 0, 1023);
}
