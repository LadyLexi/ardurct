#summary Description of the TouScruino

== Introduction ==

TouScruino is a contraction for Tou(ch) Scr(een) (Ard)uino.<br>
It is a versatile Arduino compatible board: it copies the connector positions of the Arduino Uno (Rev. 3) and offers 
almost the same functions at the same pin positions (D3 is not a PWM anymore, it became TX1). 
See [PinMapping pins mapping] for details.

== Features ==

 * Can be used as a standalone Arduino compatible board, capable of accepting shields (they are "under shields" though :)). 
 * Has a single cell LiPo charger and connector to allow battery operation, and a ULDO regulator to generate 3.3V from the LiPo battery. The charge is done through a mini USB connector.
 * Contains a screen and some input to interact with it: either a joystick, some buttons, or a touchpanel.

By default, TouScruino contains a firmware which will draw the commands passed through the Serial pins (RX=D0 and TX=D1) or the I2C pins (SCL=D19 and SDA=D20) on the screen, 
and returns upon request the state of the inputs.

== Versions ==
<img src="http://ardurct.googlecode.com/svn/images/TouScruino-versions.png"><br>
All versions can be used, they have been made as PCB and some libraries exist to interact with them.<br>
<u>v0</u><br>
Content: ATMEGA1284, PCD8544 as screen, 4 buttons for interaction.<br>
Status: finished<br>
Although usefull for simple interaction, the screen is too limited to be used for ArduRCT.
<br><br>

<u>v1</u><br>
Content: ATMEGA1284, JD-T1800 as screen, 4 buttons for interaction.<br>
Status: work in progress<br>
<br><br>

<u>v2</u>[TouScruino-v2]<br>
Content: ATMEGA1284, PJ28004 as touchscreen.<br>
Status: cancelled<br>
A bit of a deception really: the lack of a specialised chip to interact with the panel makes the all experience a bit buggy...<br>
Because in the mean time, Arduino can use more powerful arm devices, V3 has been started.

<u>v3</u><br>
Content: ATSAM3S4C, PJ28004 as touchscreen, AR1021 as eeprom and TSC.<br>
