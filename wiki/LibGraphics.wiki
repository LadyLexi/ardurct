#summary Details about the ArduRCT_Graphics library

= Arduino library for graphic screens =
===Content===
The library is designed to manage small screens such as TouScruino or the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/335">one from adafruit</a>.<br>
For the moment, it manages screens based on the S6D04H0, and the ST7735. It will soon manage ILI932x based screens.<br>
Porting the library for other screens or other MCUs is quite simple as the hardware has been completely abstracted: see [LibGraphicsCodeDetails code details]
===Pin mapping===
<u>ST7735<u>
||Arduino||GND||5V ||8  ||9  ||       ||10    ||MOSI||SCK||    ||3.3V||
||LCD    ||GND||VCC||RST||D/C||CARD_CS||TFT_CS||MOSI||SCK||MISO||LITE||
<br>The library uses hardware SPI to achieve a good refresh speed. At 16MHz, the screen can be painted any color in less than 50ms.

See schematics for [TouScruino]

===Functionalities===
The screen can be rotated by 90 degree increments.
